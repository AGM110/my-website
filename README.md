# My Automated Website

This is a simple website deployed automatically using a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.

## How It Works

1.  I write code (HTML, CSS) on my computer.
2.  I push the code to GitHub.
3.  **GitHub Actions** automatically takes that code and deploys it to **GitHub Pages**.
4.  The website goes live on the internet without me having to do anything manually!

## Live Demo
